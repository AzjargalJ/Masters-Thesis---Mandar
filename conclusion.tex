\label{cha:conclusion}
In this thesis \textit{FS-Scala}, a Scala-based implementation for training and tuning kernel based FS-LSSVM models. As a use case, the kernel based FS-LSSVM model is tested on benchmark data sets. We observed that our implementation enables scalable training, tuning and evaluation of models learning from Big Data, while still providing flexibility to tweak various underlying data processing infrastructure.
