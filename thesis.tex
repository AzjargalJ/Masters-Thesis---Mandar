  I would like to thank everybody who kept me busy the last year,
  especially my promoter and my assistants. I would also like to thank the

We propose \textit{FS-Scala}, a flexible and modular \textit{Scala} based implementation of the Fixed Size Least Squares Support Vector Machine (FS-LSSVM) for large data sets. The framework consists of a set of modules for (gradient and gradient free) optimization, model representation, kernel functions and evaluation of FS-LSSVM models. A kernel based \textit{Fixed-Size Least Squares Support Vector Machine} (FS-LSSVM) model is implemented in the proposed framework, while heavily leveraging the parallel computing capabilities of \textit{Apache Spark}. Global optimization routines like \emph{Coupled Simulated Annealing} (CSA) and \emph{Grid Search} are implemented and used to tune the hyper-parameters of the FS-LSSVM model. Finally, we carry out experiments on benchmark data sets like \emph{Magic Gamma} and \emph{Adult} and evaluate the performance of various kernel based FS-LSSVM models.
